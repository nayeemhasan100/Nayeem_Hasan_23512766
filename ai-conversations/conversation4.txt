me: What is the purpose of the parse_weather_question() function?
ai: The purpose of the parse_weather_question() function is to analyze a user’s natural-language weather question (like “What is the temperature of Bangladesh tomorrow?”) and extract key details from it — specifically:

Location – where the user is asking about (e.g., “Bangladesh”).

Time period – when they are asking about (e.g., “today,” “tomorrow,” “next 3 days”).

Attribute – what type of weather information they want (e.g., “temperature,” “rain,” “forecast”).

🧠 In simple terms:
It converts a plain English question into a structured dictionary that a program can understand and use to fetch weather data.

Example:

parse_weather_question("What is the temperature of Bangladesh tomorrow?")


➡️ Returns:

{
  "location": "Bangladesh",
  "time_period": "tomorrow",
  "attribute": "temperature"
}


So, its main purpose is to interpret and organize user input into usable information for an automated weather system or chatbot.

me: Which Python module is imported to work with regular expressions?
What type of value does the function return?
ai: The Python module imported to work with regular expressions is re.
It’s used for searching and matching text patterns (like finding a location name or date in a question).

Example from the code:

import re
The function parse_weather_question() returns a dictionary (dict).

That dictionary contains structured information extracted from the question, such as:

{
  "location": "Bangladesh",
  "time_period": "today",
  "attribute": "temperature"
}


So, its return type is a Python dictionary.

me: How to detect the time period “tomorrow”?
ai: The function detects the word “tomorrow” by checking if it appears anywhere in the user’s question string after converting it to lowercase.

Here’s the relevant part of the code:

if "tomorrow" in q:
    result["time_period"] = "tomorrow"

🧠 Step-by-step explanation:

The user’s question is first converted to lowercase:

q = question.lower()


This ensures that words like “Tomorrow” or “TOMORROW” are also recognized.

The code then checks:

If the word "tomorrow" exists anywhere inside the string q.

If found, it updates the result dictionary:

result["time_period"] = "tomorrow"

✅ Example:
parse_weather_question("What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?")


Output:

{
  "location": "Perth",
  "time_period": "tomorrow",
  "attribute": "general"
}
me: what to search by regular expression
ai: Step-by-step breakdown of what it searches for
Part	Meaning	Example it catches
\b	Word boundary → makes sure it starts cleanly at a word (not mid-word)	in Dhaka ✅
`(?:in	of	at
\s+	One or more spaces after the preposition	space between “in” and “Dhaka”
([a-z][a-z\s\-\’\'\.]+?)	Capture group → this grabs the actual location name (letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, etc.)	south australia, new york, st. louis
`(?=\s+(?:today	tomorrow	next\b)
✅ In plain English:

This regex tells Python to:

“Find any location name that comes after words like ‘in’, ‘of’, ‘at’, or ‘for’,
and stop capturing right before time-related words (like ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’, or ‘next’) or the end of the question.”


me: What string operations are used to clean punctuation from the location text?
ai: The function uses the string method .strip() and the string method combination .split() + .capitalize() to clean and format the location text after extracting it with regex.

Here’s the relevant code:

loc = loc_match.group(1).strip(" ?.!;:,")
result["location"] = " ".join(w.capitalize() for w in loc.split())

🧠 Step-by-step explanation:

loc_match.group(1)

Takes the captured location text from the regular expression (for example: "bangladesh," or "south australia?").

.strip(" ?.!;:,")

Removes unwanted punctuation or spaces from both ends of the string.

It removes characters like:
space, ?, ., !, ;, :, ,

Example:
"bangladesh," → "bangladesh"
" south australia? " → "south australia"

.split() and .capitalize() inside a list comprehension:

" ".join(w.capitalize() for w in loc.split())


.split() → breaks the text into separate words.
"south australia" → ["south", "australia"]

w.capitalize() → makes the first letter uppercase for each word.
→ ["South", "Australia"]

" ".join(...) → joins them back into one properly formatted string.
→ "South Australia"

✅ Final Result Example:

Input:  " south australia? "
Output: "South Australia"

💡 In short:

.strip() → cleans punctuation/spaces

.split() + .capitalize() → formats each word nicely

" ".join() → puts the cleaned words back together
