me: what is hands on ai and why is it used
ai: Hands-On AI is an open-source Python library and learning toolkit designed to make working with Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts practical and interactive.

It was developed mainly for education, experimentation, and prototyping — helping students, educators, and developers easily build and test AI models, chatbots, and data-driven applications without starting from scratch.

It is published on PyPI as hands-on-ai, and often used in courses or labs related to:

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Machine Learning (ML)

Large Language Models (LLMs)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

AI Agents and automation

👉 In short, it’s a teaching + prototyping framework that makes learning AI hands-on — hence the name.

⚙️ Why is it Used?

It’s used because it provides ready-made tools and templates for experimenting with AI systems.
Here’s what it helps you do:

1. Build AI Chatbots

You can use its chat module to create your own chat systems using different AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).

Example:

from hands_on_ai import chat
response = chat.ask("Explain machine learning in simple words.")
print(response)

2. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

It has a rag module that allows you to combine your own documents or knowledge base with a language model (LLM).
This makes AI answers more context-aware and accurate.

Example use cases:

Answering questions from company policies

Creating “AI search” over your PDFs or reports

Building study assistants (for university use)

3. Build and Test AI Agents

The agent module supports multi-step reasoning agents — systems that can take actions, retrieve data, and respond intelligently based on goals.

Used in:

Educational demos

Simple automation tasks

Research or experimentation on autonomous systems

4. Education and Learning

It’s commonly used in AI courses, university assignments, and workshops.
The library abstracts complex AI concepts into simple code, so learners can focus on how AI works rather than on setup.

Example course usage:

“Hands-On AI with Python”

“Building LLM-based Chatbots”

“AI for Data Science Students”

me: what is ollama and how to get api key
ai: Let’s go step-by-step so you understand what Ollama is, why people use it, and how the API key part actually works — because Ollama works a bit differently than OpenAI or Google Gemini.

🧠 What Is Ollama?

Ollama is a local AI model runner —
it lets you download and run large language models (LLMs) on your own computer instead of using cloud APIs.

In other words:

💡 Ollama = ChatGPT but running locally on your PC or server.

🔹 Key Features
Feature	Description
🏠 Local model hosting	Run models like LLaMA 3, Mistral, Phi-3, Gemma, etc. directly on your computer
🔒 Privacy	No data leaves your device — ideal for personal or offline use
⚙️ API-compatible	Exposes an OpenAI-style API (so you can connect it to apps easily)
🚀 Fast setup	One command installs it and starts a server automatically
🧩 Integrations	Works with LangChain, LlamaIndex, and many “Hands-On AI” tutorials
💻 How To Install Ollama
🪟 On Windows / macOS / Linux

Visit the official site:
👉 https://ollama.com

Click Download and install the version for your operating system.

After installation, open Terminal (mac/Linux) or Command Prompt / PowerShell (Windows).

Then test it by running:

ollama run llama3


That will:

Download the Llama 3 model (~4 GB by default)

Start a local interactive chat

You can type messages and get responses from the model

🔑 About the API Key

Here’s the important part —
Ollama does not use API keys like OpenAI or Anthropic.

Instead, it runs a local REST API on your computer, usually at:

http://localhost:11434


So any application can connect to your local Ollama server without an API key, for example:

import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
    json={"model": "llama3", "prompt": "Explain what Ollama is."}
)
print(response.json())


If you are using frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Hands-On AI, you just point them to:

OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434


— no API key required.

🌍 When Do You Need an “API Key”?

Only if you connect to remote or cloud-hosted Ollama servers (for example, your own Ollama instance on a VPS).
Then you can secure it with an API key that you generate manually in your own environment, but that’s optional — not part of the default setup.

me: what is pyinputplus
ai: Let’s break it down simply and clearly —
what pyinputplus is, what it’s used for, and how you can use it in real Python programs.

🧠 What is PyInputPlus?

PyInputPlus (short for Python Input Plus) is a Python library that makes user input handling safer, cleaner, and easier.

Normally, when you use Python’s built-in input() function, it just returns whatever the user types — even if it’s wrong or invalid.
But pyinputplus lets you automatically validate, filter, and re-prompt users until they enter correct data.

So instead of writing long loops with try...except for input validation,
you can use pyinputplus functions that handle it all for you.

⚙️ Installation

To install the library, run this command in your terminal or Jupyter notebook:

pip install pyinputplus

🧩 Basic Example
🆚 Normal input():
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print("You are", age, "years old.")


If the user types abc, it will crash or give wrong data.

✅ Using pyinputplus:
import pyinputplus as pyip

age = pyip.inputInt("Enter your age: ", min=0, max=120)
print("You are", age, "years old.")


✔ If the user types a letter → it will re-ask.
✔ If the user types a number outside 0–120 → it will re-ask.
✔ No crash — automatic validation!


me: explain this
from fetch_my_weather import get_weather
from hands_on_ai.chat import get_response
ai: Let’s break down exactly what that line of code means and what each part does, step by step — it’s actually a very nice combination of two libraries you’ve been exploring:
👉 fetch_my_weather and hands_on_ai.

🧾 The Code
from fetch_my_weather import get_weather
from hands_on_ai.chat import get_response


This code imports two specific functions from two different Python packages.
Let’s understand both parts separately.

🌦️ 1. from fetch_my_weather import get_weather
✅ What it means:

You are importing the function get_weather() from the fetch_my_weather package.

So after this import, you can directly call:

get_weather("Dhaka")

🔍 What it does:

The get_weather() function retrieves real-time weather data for a given location.
It connects to a free weather API and returns structured data like temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.

💡 Example:
from fetch_my_weather import get_weather

data = get_weather("Perth")
print(data['current']['temperature_C'])


Output (example):

29


It might also include:

{
  "location": "Perth",
  "country": "Australia",
  "current": {
    "temperature_C": "29",
    "humidity": "46",
    "wind_speed_kmph": "8"
  },
  "forecast": [...]
}


So basically, this line gives you access to weather data fetching functionality.

🤖 2. from hands_on_ai.chat import get_response
✅ What it means:

This imports the function get_response() from the chat module of the hands_on_ai package.

After this, you can write:

get_response("What is the weather like in Perth?")

🔍 What it does:

The get_response() function is designed to simulate or connect to a chat-based AI model (like ChatGPT, LLaMA, or any local model through Ollama or OpenAI).

It takes a text prompt/question, sends it to the AI engine, and returns the AI’s answer as text.

🧠 Putting It Together

You can use both functions together to build an AI-powered weather chatbot.
For example:

from fetch_my_weather import get_weather
from hands_on_ai.chat import get_response

# Step 1: Get real weather data
weather_data = get_weather("Dhaka")

# Step 2: Generate a friendly AI response
user_question = "What's the weather like in Dhaka today?"
ai_answer = get_response(
    f"The weather in Dhaka is {weather_data['current']['temperature_C']}°C with "
    f"{weather_data['current']['weather_desc']}. "
    "Summarize this nicely for a user."
)

print(ai_answer)


This way:

fetch_my_weather gives you data

hands_on_ai.chat gives you language understanding and natural text output

💬 So, you can combine both to make a chatbot that talks like:

“Today in Dhaka, it’s sunny with 31°C and light winds. Perfect day to go out!”
