# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
I used ChatGPT as the primary AI tool during the development of my Weather Check Python project. ChatGPT helped me refine my code structure, improve my understanding of regular expressions, and debug logical errors. It provided clear explanations of Python functions such as re.search(), re.findall(), and datetime handling, which made the process of extracting time and location information much easier.Additionally, ChatGPT assisted me in writing efficient and readable code by suggesting better ways to structure functions and handle exceptions. It also helped me document my work professionally by generating example outputs and reflection reports. Overall, the tool served as a virtual coding assistant that enhanced both the quality of my code and my learning experience.
## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I used a procedural prompting strategy while working with ChatGPT. Instead of asking broad questions, I gave step-by-step instructions such as “write a function to extract location using regex” or “detect the time period ‘tomorrow’.” This approach helped me receive precise and structured responses. I also refined prompts based on the previous output to improve accuracy. Using this method made the learning process more interactive and helped me understand the logic behind each part of the weather-check program.
## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
I’m proud of successfully building a functional Python program that can understand natural language questions and generate weather responses. At first, I struggled with using regular expressions and handling user input variations, but through consistent testing and problem-solving, I managed to make the code work accurately. Seeing the program correctly detect the location and time period from a sentence felt rewarding and boosted my confidence in both programming and logical thinking
## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I would integrate a real-time weather API such as OpenWeatherMap to replace the mock data used in my program. This would make the system more dynamic and realistic by displaying live temperature, humidity, and rainfall updates. I would also improve the natural language processing using libraries like spaCy or NLTK to better understand complex user questions. These enhancements would make the project more accurate, interactive, and closer to a real-world weather assistant.
## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
This project was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my programming and problem-solving skills. I gained practical knowledge of Python, regular expressions, and natural language processing, which helped me understand how AI-driven systems interpret user input. Building the weather check program boosted my confidence in writing clean, functional code and debugging effectively. Overall, it inspired me to explore more advanced topics like machine learning and API integration for smarter, real-world applications
